# Book: The Go Programming Language 

Here you will find all the studies and projects developed in Golang during my reading of the book: **[The Go Programming Language](https://shorturl.at/bjwyU)**

> source of the book **[here](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/)**

## How to run the projects?

To run the projects, you need to have the Go installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

After installing Go, you can run the projects using the command:

```bash
go run <project-name>.go
```

If you want to compile the project, you can use the command:

```bash
go build <project-name>.go
```

And if you want to see the compiled project, you can use the command:

```bash
./<project-name>
```
