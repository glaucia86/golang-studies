# # Pluralsight Course: Go Fundamentals by Mike Van Sickle (NOTES)

## Simple Data Types

- Strings:  
  - Ex.: `"Hello, World!"`
- Numbers: 
  - int: `int`
  - unsigned integers: `uint`
  - floating point numbers: `float32`, `float64`
  - complex numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`
- Booleans: `true` or `false`
- Errors: The error built-in type is the conventional interface for representing an error condition, with the nil value representing no error.
  - Ex.: `errors.New("Something went wrong")`
